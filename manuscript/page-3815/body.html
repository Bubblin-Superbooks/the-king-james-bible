I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that bare thee.</p><p>8:6 Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.</p><p>8:7 Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.</p></div> </div>
