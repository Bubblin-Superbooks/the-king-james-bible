Nay: but by the law of faith.</p><p>3:28 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.</p><p>3:29 Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also: 3:30 Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</p><p>3:31 Do we then make void the law through faith?
