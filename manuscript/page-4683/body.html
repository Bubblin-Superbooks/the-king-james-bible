God forbid.</p><p>6:16 Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? 6:17 But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.</p><p>6:18 Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.</p></div> </div>
