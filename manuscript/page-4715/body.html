All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.</p><p>14:21 It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.</p><p>14:22 Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.</p></div> </div>
