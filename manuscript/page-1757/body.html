And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.</p><p>9:33 And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode her under foot.</p><p>9:34 And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king's daughter.</p><p>9:35 And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.</p></div> </div>
