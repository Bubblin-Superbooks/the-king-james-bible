Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone; 9:33 As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.</p><p>10:1 Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.</p><p>10:2 For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.</p></div> </div>
