Be not highminded, but fear: 11:21 For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.</p><p>11:22 Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.</p><p>11:23 And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.</p><p>11:24 For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree? 11:25 For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.</p></div> </div>
