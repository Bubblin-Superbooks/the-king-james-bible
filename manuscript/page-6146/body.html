God forbid.</p><p>9:15 For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.</p><p>9:16 So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.</p><p>9:17 For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.</p></div> </div>
