That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.</p><p>9:31 But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.</p><p>9:32 Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone; 9:33 As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.</p><p>10:1 Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.</p></div> </div>
