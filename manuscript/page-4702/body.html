Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel saying, 11:3 Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.</p><p>11:4 But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.</p><p>11:5 Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</p><p>11:6 And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.</p><p>11:7 What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded.</p></div> </div>
