Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.</p><p>6:43 For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</p><p>6:44 For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.</p></div> </div>
