But his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay.</p><p>20:10 For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report, say they, and we will report it. All my familiars watched for my halting, saying, Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.</p></div> </div>
