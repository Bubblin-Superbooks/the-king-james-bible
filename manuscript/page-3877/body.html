Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.</p><p>3:10 The mountains saw thee, and they trembled: the overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands on high.</p><p>3:11 The sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy glittering spear.</p><p>3:12 Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.</p><p>3:13 Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.</p></div> </div>
