<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>10:14 If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.</p><p>10:15 If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction; 10:16 For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.</p><p>10:17 Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.</p><p>10:18 Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me! 10:19 I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.</p></div> </div>
