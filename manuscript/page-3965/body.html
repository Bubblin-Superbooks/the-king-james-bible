<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>33:12 And the people shall be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire.</p><p>33:13 Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge my might.</p><p>33:14 The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings? 33:15 He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil; 33:16 He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.</p></div> </div>
