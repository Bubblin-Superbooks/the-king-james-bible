For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.</p><p>14:13 And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.</p><p>14:14 The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.</p></div> </div>
