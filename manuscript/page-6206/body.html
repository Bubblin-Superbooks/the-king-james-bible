God forbid.</p><p>6:16 What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.</p><p>6:17 But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</p><p>6:18 Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.</p><p>6:19 What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? 6:20 For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.</p></div> </div>
