Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter, 16:21 That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them? 16:22 And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast polluted in thy blood.</p></div> </div>
