These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.</p><p>65:6 Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom, 65:7 Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the LORD, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom.</p></div> </div>
