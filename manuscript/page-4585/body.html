Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such things? or shall he break the covenant, and be delivered? 17:16 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.</p></div> </div>
