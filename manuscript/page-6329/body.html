It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.</p><p>3:20 Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.</p><p>3:21 Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.</p><p>3:22 But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.</p></div> </div>
